/**
 * Generic pagination/sorting/search state shared by every CRUD data-table
 * component, regardless of bounded context. Extracted so no future module
 * has to re-implement it (DRY, matches the existing App\Concerns pattern
 * used by ProfileValidationRules / PasswordValidationRules).
 *
 * Two table modes are supported, selected per-component via the
 * `$tableMode` property:
 *
 *  - 'client' (default): the full collection is fetched from the
 *    Application layer ONCE per Livewire render and handed to Alpine.js
 *    as JSON (see resources/js/data-table.js — `crudTable`). Search, sort
 *    and pagination are then resolved entirely in the browser: zero
 *    Livewire round-trips until an actual mutation (create/update/delete)
 *    happens. Intended for small, reference-style datasets — roles,
 *    permissions, catalogs, statuses, etc.
 *
 *  - 'server': classic Livewire-driven pagination. Search/sort/page
 *    changes trigger a request to the server, as is required once a
 *    dataset is too large to ship to the browser in one response.
 *
 * A concrete component only needs to:
 *   1. Set `protected string $tableMode = 'client' | 'server';`
 *   2. In `render()`, branch on `$this->isServerMode()` and call the
 *      matching Application UseCase method (`all()` vs `paginate()`).
 *
 * Everything else — the four pagination actions, the sort toggle, and
 * resetting the page on search/perPage changes — is inherited.

     * changes the underlying data.
     *
     * No-op in server mode, where Livewire's normal re-render already
     * updates the DOM correctly on its own — every concrete component's
